With [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Babel]] you can easily execute code for a variety of languages from within orgmode.

To configure Babel for the languages I wanted to execute, I put the following in my ~.emacs.d/init.el~ config.

{{< highlight lisp>}}
;; Configure babel for these languages
(org-babel-do-load-languages
  'org-babel-load-languages
  '((python . t)
    (shell . t)
    (dot . t)
    (org . t)
    (scheme . t)
    ))

;; run code blocks without prompting first
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)

{{< /highlight>}}


Then make a new .org file and try running a snippet in the file.
{{< highlight python >}}

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
for x in range(0,3):
  print("Hello world")
#+END_SRC
{{< /highlight >}}

Execute the code using C-c C-c (Control-c Control-c) with the cursor in the SRC block.

The results are included in the file like magic. 
{{< highlight org >}}
#+RESULTS:
: Hello world
: Hello world
: Hello world
{{< /highlight >}}

*** Graphviz

It's particularly handy for [[https://www.graphviz.org/documentation/][Graphviz]]. You get a nicely interactive way to draw Graphs.

Execute the block the same way with C-c C-c and you get a link to the graph.

{{< highlight org >}}

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file graphviz.png

digraph architecture {
node [color=green] [shape=box]; "A"
node [color=blue] [shape=oval]; "B", "C"
"A" -> "B";
"B" -> "C";
"C" -> "A";
"C" -> "D";
"D" -> "E";
"E" -> "B";
}

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:graphviz.png]]

{{< /highlight >}}

#+CAPTION: Output of the above dot source

#+CAPTION: Since you can view images with Emacs, you can split the window (C-x 3) to preview the graph as you build it.
